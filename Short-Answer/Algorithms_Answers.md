## Exercise II
I would look at how many floors we have try to eliminate as many as possible by going to the halfway mark and starting from there.  I would know if I am too far up, the egg will crack and I can move down from there.  if not, I know I can go up using the same method.  This would eliminate having to go to every floor.
